# AI Resume Analyzer

This project uses AI to give feedback on resumes. The idea is simple: you upload a resume and a job description, and the tool compares them. It points out missing keywords, gives writing suggestions, and shows how well your resume matches the job. The goal is to make it easier for people to tailor their resumes for specific roles.

## Overview

The project uses a large language model through an API like OpenAI or OpenRouter. The model reads both the resume and the job description, then gives feedback on things like keyword usage, tone, and relevance.  
It’s a small example of how AI can help with a real problem—making resumes more effective and improving job search results.
